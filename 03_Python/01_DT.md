# Python Data Types Comparison: Lists, Tuples, Dictionaries

This table explains when to use **Lists**, **Tuples**, and **Dictionaries** in Python, along with the situation, reasons, and examples.

| Situation                             | Data Type     | Why Use It                                                                 | Example |
|---------------------------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| Need an ordered collection that can change | List          | Lists are mutable and keep insertion order                              | `marks = [90, 85, 70]` |
| Need an ordered collection that shouldn't change | Tuple         | Tuples are immutable and safer for fixed data                           | `point = (3, 4)` |
| Need to label data with keys          | Dictionary    | Dictionaries store data in key-value pairs                              | `student = {"name": "Alice", "age": 20}` |
| Need to add or remove items frequently | List          | Lists have methods like `append`, `remove`, `pop`                       | `fruits.append("apple")` |
| Need fast lookup by a known key       | Dictionary    | Lookup by key is very fast (O(1) time)                                  | `student["age"]` |
| Want to prevent accidental changes    | Tuple         | Tuples canâ€™t be changed, good for constants                             | `DAYS = ("Mon", "Tue", "Wed")` |
| Want to store multiple data types     | List/Tuple     | Both can hold different data types together                             | `[1, "apple", True]` or `(1, "apple", True)` |
| Want to store structured data         | Dictionary    | Each piece of data can be labeled with a key                           | `{"title": "Book", "price": 200}` |
| Don't care about labels, just a sequence | List/Tuple     | Use list if it will change, tuple if fixed                              | `[1, 2, 3]` or `(1, 2, 3)` |
