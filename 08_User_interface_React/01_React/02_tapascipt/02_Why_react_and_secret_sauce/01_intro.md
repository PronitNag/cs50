# what is react?

-React is a declarative,Component-based,javascript-library for building user-interface

## what is declarative?

-In declarative programming, you describe what you want to do but do not specify how it is done

## what is Imperative?

-In Imperative programming, we decribe what we want to doby specifying all the instruction on how to do it.

## But how can we prove that React is declarative?

**Notice** that we don't have any ul elements in the jsx but how is is apperaring, and there is no getelemmentbyId(),
In short it is doing **DOMmanipulation** by itself, it can be said that is layer of abstraction so that we can think of the bussiness logic

## What is a component?

- A component is an isolated unit which has all this logic,presentation logic  and Api integration within itself
- Which means one componenet can be developed, tested, in isolation from another component
- and multiple component can get together, integrated and perform testing

- the advantage is that each person can work on their own compoenent

we also place focus of the herarchy of component

## Why is react a library not a framework?

library foucs on one thing whereas , framework does multiple things

react was made to solve single page interface problem in development

to be a framework it need to have a few more things

The Things are:
1-Theming
2-Routing(Inbuild Routing)
3-testing(Inbuild testing)
4- Data fecthing(we use axios)
5- Build(web pack, parcel)
6- State management(Redux)
7- Notifications
8- anything Practically 

for doing anything we need to bring in additional library
