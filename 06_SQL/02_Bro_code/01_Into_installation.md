# Q) What is SQL?
```text
Structured Query Language, or SQL,
is the primary programming language used to manage and interact with relational databases.
SQL can perform various operations such as creating, updating, reading, and deleting records within a database.
```

#  what are the different type of data base?

```text
 there's two types of databases I'll discuss 
relational and non-relational a table in a 
relational database it resembles an Excel 
spreadsheet there's rows and columns 
tables within a relational database can 
form well relationships with one another 
and that is done by this concept of **keys** 

 then
 
there's non-relational databases that's 
where our data is organized in any 
format but a table this could include
** Json files **
** key value pairs **
** graph data structures ** 
entities of that nature to utilize data in a 
relational database we would use SQL 
then with a non-relational database we 
would use a different language named 
nosql meaning not only SQL 
```

# Where will we write our SQL statements?

```text
to write SQL statements we would need the help of a 
special piece of software known as a database management 
system people shorten this to Simply 
dbms it's a workspace for us to write SQL 
statements and generally just work with 
our database
